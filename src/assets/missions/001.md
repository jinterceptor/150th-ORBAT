## SITREP

ONI decryption and analysis of recovered field traffic has identified the origin point of Project **DAYBREAK** activity. The source is confirmed to be located on the ice moon **Hecate**, orbiting **Kharon 1** in the **Kharon Reach** system.

150th Broadsword RRG is the closest available UNSC element. **UNSC Midnight Light** has altered course and has just dropped out of **Slipspace** and is on final approach. No additional fleet assets are expected to arrive before our initial assault.

Upon arrival in-system, multiple derelict mining platforms have been identified within the local asteroid field. These installations have been refitted into active defensive stations and are denying orbital access to **Hecate**.

Midnight Light is unable to safely maneuver within the asteroid field or bring ship-mounted weapons to bear on the platforms. No clear approach vector for a conventional landing exists at this time.

Mission will proceed via <span class="badge badge-blue">DIRECT EVA ASSAULT</span>.

## OBJECTIVE UPDATE

<div class="objective">
  <div class="obj-id">OBJ 1</div>
  <div class="obj-title">CORVETTE SEIZURE</div>
  Locate and secure enemy corvette operating within the asteroid field. Prevent scuttling. Capture navigation and command data if possible.
</div>

<div class="objective">
  <div class="obj-id">OBJ 2</div>
  <div class="obj-title">DEFENCE STATION ALPHA</div>
  Board and secure first defensive platform. Disable weapons systems and establish local control.
</div>

<div class="objective">
  <div class="obj-id">OBJ 3</div>
  <div class="obj-title">DEFENCE STATION BRAVO</div>
  Board and secure second defensive platform. Neutralize remaining orbital denial capability.
</div>

<hr />

## NOTES

- Expect vacuum operations, limited maneuvering space, and zero-visibility sectors.
- Stations were originally civilian mining infrastructure. Structural integrity may be compromised.
- Resistance is expected to be organized and professional.
- Completion of objectives will open a landing corridor for surface operations on **Hecate**.
