## SUBJECT
**OPERATION DEAD ORBIT // INITIAL ASSAULT PHASE**

---

## SITREP
ONI decryption and analysis of recovered field traffic has identified the origin point of **Project DAYBREAK** activity. The source is confirmed to be located on the ice moon **Hecate**, orbiting **Kharon 1** in the **Kharon Reach** system.

**150th Broadsword RRG** is the closest available UNSC element. **UNSC Midnight Light** has altered course and has just dropped out of Slipspace and is on final approach. No additional fleet assets are expected to arrive before our initial assault.

Upon arrival in-system, multiple derelict mining platforms have been identified within the local asteroid field. These installations have been refitted into active defensive stations and are denying orbital access to Hecate.

Midnight Light is unable to safely maneuver within the asteroid field or bring ship-mounted weapons to bear on the platforms. No clear approach vector for a conventional landing exists at this time.

**Mission will proceed via direct EVA assault.**

## OBJECTIVES

### OBJ 1 // CORVETTE SEIZURE
- Locate and secure enemy corvette operating within the asteroid field.  
- Prevent scuttling.  
- Capture navigation and command data if possible.

### OBJ 2 // DEFENSE STATION ALPHA
- Board and secure first defensive platform.  
- Disable weapons systems and establish local control.

### OBJ 3 // DEFENSE STATION BRAVO
- Board and secure second defensive platform.  
- Neutralize remaining orbital denial capability.

---

## NOTES / COMMAND GUIDANCE
- Expect vacuum operations, limited maneuvering space, and zero-visibility sectors.  
- Stations were originally civilian mining infrastructure; structural integrity may be compromised.  
- Resistance is expected to be organized and professional.  
- Completion of objectives will open a landing corridor for surface operations on Hecate.
