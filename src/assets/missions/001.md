SITREP:

ONI decryption and analysis of recovered field traffic has identified the origin point of Project DAYBREAK activity. The source is confirmed to be located on the ice moon Hecate, orbiting Kharon 1 in the Kharon Reach system.

150th Broadsword RRG is the closest available UNSC element. UNSC Midnight Light has altered course and has just dropped out of Slipsace and is on final approach. No additional fleet assets are expected to arrive before our initial assault.

Upon arrival in-system, multiple derelict mining platforms have been identified within the local asteroid field. These installations have been refitted into active defensive stations and are denying orbital access to Hecate.

Midnight Light is unable to safely maneuver within the asteroid field or bring ship-mounted weapons to bear on the platforms. No clear approach vector for a conventional landing exists at this time.

Mission will proceed via direct EVA assault.
