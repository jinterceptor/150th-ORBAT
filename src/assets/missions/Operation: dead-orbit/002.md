## SITREP

<pre class="terminal">The orbital assault against hostile platforms in the <strong>Hecate</strong> asteroid belt has concluded successfully. All identified defence stations have been neutralized, and <strong>UNSC Midnight Light</strong> has established geosynchronous orbit above the primary laboratory complex on <strong>Hecate</strong>.

Surface reconnaissance confirms that Meridian Defence Treaty Forces (<strong>MDTF</strong>) elements are heavily entrenched around the facility. Enemy forces have constructed layered trench systems, hardened firing points, and overlapping fields of fire.

Environmental conditions on <strong>Hecate</strong> are severe. Extreme cold and exposure risks significantly limit the amount of time our infantry can safely operate in the open. The Meridian forces were prepared.

A direct, sustained push will be required.

To support ground operations, an up-armoured command <strong>ELEPHANT</strong> will be deployed planetside to act as a mobile command post, logistics hub, and hardened shelter. The platform will serve as a forward base to sustain momentum and provide recovery space for engaged units.

Severe storms will delay surface reinforcement windows. Command has assigned <strong>30 reinforcements</strong>. If we exhaust them, operations will halt until additional fleet assets arrive.<span class="cursor"></span></pre>

## OBJECTIVE UPDATE

<div class="objective">
<div class="obj-id">OBJ 1</div>
<div class="obj-title">LINEBREAKER</div>
Conduct a coordinated assault through the outer defensive trench network. Collapse enemy forward positions and establish a breach corridor toward the facility perimeter.
</div>

<div class="objective">
<div class="obj-id">OBJ 2</div>
<div class="obj-title">DEEPFREEZE</div>
Seize and secure the enemy liquid nitrogen storage plant. Deny its use to hostile forces and repurpose the structure as a staging and resupply point.
</div>

<div class="objective">
<div class="obj-id">OBJ 3</div>
<div class="obj-title">DOOR KNOCK</div>
Assume control of the upper levels of the primary laboratory facility. Clear resistance, secure access points, and prepare for follow-on operations within the complex.
</div>

<div class="briefing-panel warning">
<div class="briefing-overline">Operational Notes</div>
<ul>
<li>Exposure time outside hardened cover is limited. Plan movement accordingly.</li>
<li>Enemy fortifications are prepared and well-supplied. Expect disciplined resistance.</li>
<li><strong>ELEPHANT</strong> platform is critical to sustained operations. Its loss may end the assault until a replacement can be deployed.</li>
<li>Successful completion of objectives enables deeper penetration into the facility and transition to internal operations.</li>
<li>Severe storms will slow reinforcement from ship to ground. Reinforcement pool is capped at <strong>30</strong> for this phase.</li>
</ul>
