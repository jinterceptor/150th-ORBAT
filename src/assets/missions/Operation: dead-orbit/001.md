## SITREP

<pre class="terminal">ONI decryption and analysis of recovered field traffic has identified the origin point of Project <strong>DAYBREAK</strong> activity. The source is confirmed to be located on the ice moon <strong>Hecate</strong>, orbiting <strong>Kharon 1</strong> in the <strong>Kharon Reach</strong> system.

150th Broadsword RRG is the closest available UNSC element. <strong>UNSC Midnight Light</strong> has altered course and has just dropped out of <strong>Slipspace</strong> and is on final approach. No additional fleet assets are expected to arrive before our initial assault.

Upon arrival in-system, multiple derelict mining platforms have been identified within the local asteroid field. These installations have been refitted into active defensive stations and are denying orbital access to <strong>Hecate</strong>.

Midnight Light is unable to safely maneuver within the asteroid field or bring ship-mounted weapons to bear on the platforms. No clear approach vector for a conventional landing exists at this time.

Mission will proceed via <span class="badge badge-blue">DIRECT EVA ASSAULT</span>.<span class="cursor"></span></pre>
